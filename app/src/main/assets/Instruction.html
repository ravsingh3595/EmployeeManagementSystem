<p>Employment Management System is basically  used to build an application program that a company uses to manage the records of the employees working in a company.
    Only the administration has rights to work with the system. This application helps to calculate the payroll of an employee based on the hours they worked  by their pay rate per hour and also add all the incentives they receive according to their employment type. For example they are working Full-time, Part-time or as Intern .It also shows the other information about that particular employee like Name, age, vehicle they have etc.
